# SchoolHomework
This is my homework from my degree.

Each subject that I learn, I write a library with functions that are related to the subject.

This libraries helps me to write my ideas without repeating codes.

P.S
Some of the libraries are exercises that I get as homework, but most of it is functions that make my life easier. (Extra functions).
